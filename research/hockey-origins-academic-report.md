# The Celtic Roots of Ice Hockey: An Academic Investigation into the Scottish and Irish Origins of Canada's National Winter Sport

## Abstract

This research report examines the pre-Canadian origins of ice hockey, tracing the sport's ancestral lineage through Celtic stick-and-ball games, particularly the Scottish sport of shinty (*camanachd*) and the Irish game of hurling (*iomáint*). Through analysis of historical records, etymological evidence, and migration patterns, this study argues that ice hockey emerged not as a Canadian invention *ex nihilo*, but rather as an evolutionary adaptation of ancient Gaelic sporting traditions transplanted to North American soil through patterns of colonial settlement and cultural exchange. The report further examines the often-overlooked contributions of the Mi'kmaq First Nation and the role of British military personnel in synthesizing these diverse influences into the modern sport.

## 1. Introduction

Ice hockey occupies a singular position in Canadian national identity, yet its origins remain a subject of considerable scholarly debate. While popular narratives often locate the sport's genesis in 19th-century Canada, mounting historical evidence suggests that hockey's true roots extend across the Atlantic to the Celtic nations of Scotland and Ireland, where stick-and-ball games have been documented for over two millennia.

The International Ice Hockey Federation recognizes March 3, 1875, as the date of the first organized indoor hockey match, played at Montreal's Victoria Skating Rink (IIHF, 2019). However, this date marks not the invention of hockey, but rather the formalization of a sport that had been evolving through centuries of cultural transmission, migration, and adaptation.

This report undertakes a comprehensive examination of hockey's Celtic predecessors, analyzing the historical development of shinty and hurling, their transmission to North America through Scottish and Irish emigration, and their subsequent fusion with Indigenous sporting traditions to produce the game recognized today as ice hockey.

## 2. Ancient Origins: Stick-and-Ball Games in Celtic Antiquity

### 2.1 Hurling: Ireland's Three-Thousand-Year Tradition

Hurling (*iomáint* or *iománaíocht*) stands among the world's oldest organized field sports, with documented history extending approximately three thousand years into Irish antiquity. The earliest literary reference to the sport appears in texts dating to 1272 BCE, describing the game's presence at Cath Maige Tuired (the Battle of Moytura), though archaeological evidence of hurley balls (*sliotars*) dates to the latter half of the 12th century CE (GAA, 2024).

The sport features prominently in Irish mythology, most notably in the *Táin Bó Cúailnge* (The Cattle Raid of Cooley), an epic dating to the 7th century CE. This foundational text of Irish literature recounts the exploits of the hero Setanta, who earned the name Cú Chulainn ("Hound of Culann") after killing a fierce guard dog by driving a hurling ball (*sliotar*) down its throat using his curved stick (*camán*) (Elverys, 2024). Such mythological accounts positioned hurling not merely as recreation but as martial training, where proficiency on the hurling field was equated with skill in battle.

The Brehon Laws, Ireland's ancient Celtic legal code, explicitly recognized hurling, establishing compensation protocols for injuries sustained during play—evidence of the sport's formal recognition within Celtic society. These laws distinguish between accidental and deliberate harm, suggesting organized play with understood rules and conventions.

In its earliest forms, hurling was played with a curved stick (*camán*) and a ball fashioned from animal skin or other materials. The objective involved striking the ball between two markers—often trees or stones—across undefined playing fields that could encompass hills, bogs, and open country. No standardized pitch existed; the game adapted to whatever terrain was available (Culture Trip, 2024).

The sport's cultural significance warranted British colonial attention: hurling was banned twice during English occupation—in 1336 under the Statutes of Kilkenny and again in 1537—as authorities feared that gatherings of young Irish men might presage rebellion (Elverys, 2024). Despite these prohibitions, hurling persisted, experiencing what historians term a "Golden Age" during the 18th century.

### 2.2 Shinty: Scotland's Highland Tradition

Shinty (*camanachd* in Scottish Gaelic) represents Scotland's parallel development of Celtic stick-and-ball games, with roots traceable to the 6th-8th centuries CE. Historical evidence suggests at least two thousand years of continuous play in the Scottish Highlands, though mythological accounts extend this timeline considerably further (Discover Highlands and Islands, 2024).

The sport shares its origin myths with hurling: legends describe the heroes Cúchulainn and Fionn Mac Cumhaill playing shinty long before recorded history. This shared mythology reflects the common Celtic heritage of both Ireland and Scotland, with shinty likely arriving in Scotland through Irish settlement during the early medieval period.

The camán (from the Scottish and Irish Gaelic word *cam*, meaning "bent" or "crooked") was traditionally fashioned from any hooked piece of wood available locally—often ash, though island communities reportedly used kelp when timber was scarce (EBSCO Research, 2024). Modern regulations, established since the 1920s, require all camáns to pass through a ring of two-and-a-half inches diameter.

Shinty evolved within the clan system of Highland Scotland, where chiefs assembled their people for military exercises and social gatherings that included sporting competition. Following the failed Jacobite uprising of 1745 and the subsequent suppression of clan structures, shinty transitioned from clan-based competition to organized league play. The Camanachd Association was established in 1893 at Kingussie, unifying the disparate regional rule variations that had developed across Highland communities (Scotland.com, 2024).

Contemporary shinty maintains formal connections with its Irish cousin: the Camanachd Association and the Gaelic Athletic Association observe agreed-upon composite rules for international shinty-hurling competitions, allowing Scottish and Irish teams to compete against one another in a format that acknowledges both traditions.

### 2.3 Etymological Evidence

The linguistic heritage of hockey reveals its Celtic origins with remarkable clarity. The word "puck"—the frozen rubber disc central to modern ice hockey—derives from the Scottish Gaelic *puc* or Irish *poc*, meaning "to poke, punch, or deliver a blow." As the Austin Hockey Association notes, "The blow given by a hurler to the ball with his camán or hurley is always called a puck" (The Hockey Writers, 2024).

Similarly, the informal Canadian game "shinny" (also spelled "shinney")—referring to pond hockey or any unorganized hockey game—takes its name directly from shinty. This linguistic survival demonstrates the persistence of Celtic influence in Canadian hockey culture, even as the sport's formal development obscured its origins.

## 3. English Contributions: Bandy and the Fenland Tradition

While Celtic games provide hockey's primary ancestral lineage, English bandy contributed significant elements to the sport's development. Bandy originated in the Fen districts of East Anglia during the 18th century, where large expanses of ice formed on flooded meadows during winter months.

Fen skating traditions date to at least medieval times, with references to stick-and-ball games on ice appearing as early as the winter of 1607-08 (Admiral Sports, 2024). A 1797 engraving discovered by Swedish sport historians Carl Gidén and Patrick Houda depicts a skater with stick and bung on the River Thames, likely from December 1796—providing visual evidence of the sport's English practice.

The first confirmed bandy matches date to 1813-14, though the sport had reportedly been played in the Fens for over a century prior. The Bury Fen Bandy Club published the first formal rules in 1882, subsequently introducing the game to other European nations.

According to sport historian Kenth Hansen, "The origin of ice hockey was bandy, a game that has its roots in the Middle Ages." Indeed, no clear distinction between bandy and ice hockey existed before the 1920s, suggesting considerable overlap in equipment, rules, and playing style during the formative period of both sports (Britannica, 2024).

## 4. Transmission to North America: Migration and Cultural Exchange

### 4.1 Scottish and Irish Emigration

The transmission of Celtic stick-and-ball games to North America occurred primarily through patterns of Scottish and Irish emigration during the 18th and 19th centuries. Scottish settlers, particularly from the Highlands, brought shinty to their new homes in Nova Scotia, Upper Canada, and other British North American colonies.

The Scottish diaspora's influence proved particularly significant. As the EBSCO Research database notes, "Those Scots who moved to Canada played shinty in winter on ice, and helped develop the sport of ice hockey" (EBSCO, 2024). The adaptation of shinty from grass to frozen lakes and rivers represented a natural response to Canadian winters, maintaining the essential elements of the game while accommodating environmental conditions.

Irish emigrants similarly carried hurling traditions across the Atlantic. The Society for International Hockey Research (SIHR) identifies the earliest written reference to ice-based stick games in a Scottish text from 1607-08: *The Historie of the Kirk of Scotland*, published in 1646, references the game of "chamiare"—another term for shinty according to the Scottish National Dictionary.

British soldiers stationed throughout North America played a crucial role in disseminating these sports. As Britannica notes, "British soldiers and immigrants to Canada and the United States brought their stick-and-ball games with them and played them on the ice and snow of winter. The British [English] played bandy, the Scots played shinty and golf, the Irish, hurling, while the Dutch soldiers probably pursued ken jaegen" (Britannica, 2024).

### 4.2 The Mi'kmaq Contribution

Recent scholarship has significantly revised understanding of Indigenous contributions to hockey's development. Research conducted since the mid-1980s has documented a hockey-like game played by the Mi'kmaq (Micmac) people in Nova Scotia during the early 1800s—a game that appeared "heavily influenced by the Irish game of hurling" yet remained distinctly Indigenous in character.

The Mi'kmaq called their ice game "Oochamkunutk." Written accounts from the 18th century describe Mi'kmaq stick-and-ball games played both on land and on ice, predating many European settler accounts of similar activities (CBC News, 2019). Oral traditions passed through Mi'kmaq communities maintain that these games predated European contact entirely.

Cheryl Maloney's great-great-grandfather, known as "Old Joe" Cope, was a Mi'kmaw hockey stick maker and photographer from Sipekne'katik who died in 1951. In 1943, Cope wrote to a Halifax newspaper stating: "Long before the pale faces strayed to this country, the [Mi'kmaq] were playing two ball games, a field game and an ice game" (CBC News, 2019).

The Mi'kmaq contribution extended beyond gameplay to equipment manufacture. Early hockey sticks were carved from Hornbeam trees (*Ostrya Virginiana*), native to Nova Scotia and prized for their exceptional durability (known colloquially as "Ironwood"). Mi'kmaq craftsmen used traditional "Crooked Knives" to shape these sticks.

In 1863, Star Manufacturing Company in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, began purchasing hockey sticks from Mi'kmaq craftsmen in bulk, distributing them as the "Mic-Mac hockey stick." Following hockey's explosion in popularity during the 1890s, the Mic-Mac stick became the best-selling hockey stick internationally (New England Historical Society, 2024).

Novelist Thomas H. Raddall documented this cultural exchange: "When [soldiers] were transferred to military posts along the St. Lawrence and the Great Lakes, they took the game with them; and for some time afterwards continued to send to Dartmouth Indians for the necessary sticks."

Hockey historian David Carter characterizes the Mi'kmaq as "the roots of ice hockey," acknowledging that while the precise origins remain debated, Indigenous contributions were fundamental rather than incidental (CBC News, 2019).

## 5. The Montreal Synthesis: Formalization of Modern Hockey

### 5.1 James Creighton and the 1875 Match

The formalization of ice hockey as an organized sport with standardized rules occurred in Montreal during the 1870s, orchestrated primarily by James George Aylwin Creighton (1850-1930). Born in Halifax, Nova Scotia—a region where Scottish, Irish, Mi'kmaq, and British military sporting traditions had already begun to merge—Creighton brought this hybrid game to Montreal when he moved there to pursue studies in engineering.

As a member of the Victoria Skating Club, Creighton organized early morning sessions of informal hockey at the Victoria Skating Rink with friends from McGill University and fellow club members. On March 3, 1875, he organized the first recorded indoor game of organized ice hockey (Nova Scotia Sport Hall of Fame, 2024).

Creighton's contributions extended beyond mere organization:
- He taught participants to play the game
- He secured access to the Victoria Skating Rink
- He wrote the "Halifax Rules" by which the game was played
- He captained the winning team
- He arranged for two dozen sticks to be sent from Halifax

The match pitted two nine-man teams against each other in a contest divided into two halves. To prevent injuries to spectators and damage to glass windows, players used "a flat block of wood" rather than a lacrosse ball—an innovation that would evolve into the modern puck (ESPN, 2017).

Creighton's team defeated the opposition led by Charles Torrance by a score of two "games" (goals) to one. The event's aftermath proved contentious: the *Kingston British Whig Standard* reported that "A disgraceful sight took place at Montreal in the Victoria Rink over a game of hockey. Shins and heads were battered, benches smashed, and the lady spectators fled in confusion." This brawl occurred not between the teams but between players and Victoria Skating Club members who "had seen enough of this new game and wanted their ice back" (History.com, 2024).

### 5.2 The "Halifax Rules" and Earlier Development

The "Halifax Rules" that governed the 1875 match derived from games already being played in Nova Scotia, where the synthesis of Celtic, Indigenous, and British military sporting traditions had produced a recognizable precursor to modern hockey. This chronology indicates that while Montreal hosted hockey's formal debut, the game itself had developed elsewhere.

The players adopted elements from multiple traditions:
- The "bully" (later the face-off) from field hockey
- "Shinning" techniques from shinty
- Equipment and stick-making from Mi'kmaq traditions
- The ice-skating context from bandy

This amalgamation evolved into the informal ice game known as "shinny" or "shinty"—terms still used in Canada to describe recreational hockey (Britannica, 2024).

## 6. Rules Codification and Institutional Development

### 6.1 The Montreal Rules

Following the 1875 match, hockey in Montreal developed rapidly. In 1877, several McGill University students codified the first formal rules, drawing from field hockey regulations while adapting them for ice play. These "Montreal Rules" included:

- The replacement of the ball with a flat wooden puck
- Goals marked by wooden posts (later with crossbars)
- Limits on the number of players per side
- Prohibition on forward passing

The Montreal Hockey Club, founded in 1877, became the first organized hockey club, followed by the formation of the Amateur Hockey Association of Canada in 1886.

### 6.2 The Stanley Cup and Professional Era

Governor General Lord Stanley of Preston donated the Stanley Cup in 1893, establishing what would become hockey's most prestigious trophy. The National Hockey League was founded in 1917, initiating the professional era that would carry the sport globally.

Throughout this institutionalization, the game's Celtic heritage remained visible in terminology (puck, shinny), playing style (the physical contact reminiscent of hurling and shinty), and equipment design (the curved stick descended directly from the camán).

## 7. Discussion: Contested Origins and National Identity

### 7.1 The Windsor-Montreal Debate

Canadian hockey historiography has featured considerable debate between partisans of Windsor, Nova Scotia, and Montreal, Quebec, as the "birthplace" of hockey. The SIHR's recognition of the 1875 Montreal match as the first "organized" indoor game has not resolved these disputes.

The Windsor claim rests on documented references to hockey being played there as early as 1800, with the Long Pond at Windsor serving as an informal playing field. Proponents argue that Creighton himself learned the game in Nova Scotia before bringing it to Montreal.

From an academic perspective, this debate misframes the question. Hockey was not "invented" at a single location but evolved through continuous cultural transmission and adaptation. The search for a single birthplace reflects nationalist impulses more than historical reality.

### 7.2 Decentering the Canadian Narrative

This report's examination of Celtic origins suggests the need to decenter Canadian national narratives from hockey's historiography. While Canada unquestionably modernized, formalized, and popularized the sport, characterizing hockey as a "Canadian invention" obscures the contributions of:

- Scottish emigrants who brought shinty traditions
- Irish emigrants who contributed hurling influences
- Mi'kmaq craftsmen and players who shaped equipment and gameplay
- British soldiers who served as vectors of cultural transmission
- English bandy players who demonstrated ice-skating adaptations

A more accurate historical framing positions Canada as the location where these diverse influences converged and crystallized into modern ice hockey—a site of synthesis rather than origination.

## 8. Conclusion

The origins of ice hockey extend far beyond the frozen ponds of 19th-century Canada to the ancient Celtic sporting traditions of Scotland and Ireland. Hurling, documented in Irish literature for over three thousand years, and shinty, practiced in the Scottish Highlands for at least two millennia, provided the foundational elements of stick-and-ball gameplay that would eventually be adapted to ice.

The transmission of these traditions to North America occurred through Scottish and Irish emigration, British military deployment, and cultural exchange with Indigenous peoples—particularly the Mi'kmaq of Nova Scotia, whose contributions to hockey's development deserve greater scholarly recognition.

The 1875 Montreal match organized by James Creighton marks not hockey's invention but its formal institutionalization—the moment when an evolving synthesis of Celtic, Indigenous, and British sporting traditions crystallized into a recognizable modern sport. The "Halifax Rules" Creighton employed derived from games already being played in Nova Scotia, which themselves descended from games played for centuries across the British Isles.

Understanding hockey's Celtic roots enriches rather than diminishes appreciation for the sport's Canadian development. It positions hockey within a longer history of human athletic expression, connecting contemporary NHL competition to the mythological feats of Cú Chulainn on Irish hurling fields and the clan gatherings of Highland Scotland. This deeper historical consciousness reveals hockey not as the product of a single national genius but as a collaborative human achievement spanning millennia and continents.
